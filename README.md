# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

Based on the content of your PDF paper, here's a professional and comprehensive `README.md` file for your GitHub repository:

# ♻️ EcoVision – Predictive Waste Management and Recycling Optimization Using Machine Learning

EcoVision is an AI-powered system that enables industries to efficiently manage and optimize wastewater treatment and recycling using machine learning and real-time analytics. Designed to support sustainable industrial practices, the system predicts wastewater generation patterns, classifies recyclability, and ensures regulatory compliance through data-driven decision-making.

## 🚀 Features

* 📊 **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast future wastewater generation trends using ML models.
* 🤖 **Ensemble Learning**: Integrated Voting Classifier combining Naïve Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest.
* ⚖️ **Class Imbalance Handling**: SMOTE for oversampling minority classes in training data.
* 📈 **Visualization**: Confusion matrices, bar charts, and heatmaps for insightful data interpretation.
* ✅ **Compliance Monitoring**: Compares wastewater data with CPCB environmental standards.
* 🧠 **AI Chatbot**: NLP-powered chatbot for real-time compliance checks.
* 📝 **Report Generation**: Automatic CSV reports with classification and compliance details.
* 🗄️ **Dynamic Database**: PostgreSQL/MongoDB integration for structured record storage and retrieval.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

1. **Data Upload**
   Upload structured wastewater datasets (CSV) via a React.js-based web interface.

2. **Preprocessing & Validation**
   Clean and validate data using Pandas and NumPy, and benchmark against Indian environmental standards.

3. **Wastewater Classification**
   Classify samples as recyclable or non-recyclable using trained ML models and feature selection.

4. **Prediction & Ensemble Modeling**
   Use a soft-voting ensemble of Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and SVM for robust predictions.

5. **Visualization & Analysis**
   Interactive visualizations for better interpretation using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

6. **Compliance Reporting**
   Automatically detect violations and generate structured reports for submission.

7. **AI Chatbot for Verification**
   Use LLMs to query environmental standards and validate sample compliance in real time.

## 📊 Technologies Used

* **Frontend**: React.js
* **Backend**: Flask (Python)
* **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, SMOTE (imbalanced-learn)
* **Database**: PostgreSQL / MongoDB
* **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Chatbot NLP**: Large Language Models (LLMs)
* **Reporting**: ReportLab

## 📈 Performance Highlights

* ✅ **Classification Accuracy**: 96%
* ⚠️ **Non-Compliance Detection**: 92%
* 🔄 **Prediction Accuracy (Voting Classifier)**: 85%
* 💬 **Chatbot Compliance Accuracy**: 94%
* ⚡ **Processing Speed**: ≤1 second for 500 datasets
* 💾 **Scalability**: Over 1 million records supported in FAISS database

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Integration of IoT sensors for real-time wastewater monitoring
* Deployment on cloud platforms for global accessibility
* Advanced ML: LSTM/Transformer-based models for time-series predictions
* Blockchain for secure regulatory data logging
* Geospatial mapping of wastewater contamination zones
